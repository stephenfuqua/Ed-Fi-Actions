# action-allowedlist

Scan `.github/workflows/` for `.yml files` and loop through all workflows,
checking their versions against a list of approved authors and versions
contained in `approved.json`

Used in lieu of Github Enterprise [Allow specified
actions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#allowing-specific-actions-to-run)
for private repositories.

## Example usage

Minimal uses expression to use this action:

``` yaml
- uses: ./actions-allowedlist
  name: Scan used actions
  id: scan-action
```

Note: this will check the current repo against the actions contained in
`approved.json`.

Example for calling this action from a different repository:

```yml
- uses: Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-Actions/action-allowedlist@latest
  name: Scan used actions
  id: scan-action
```

‚ùó In this one case, it is appropriate to use a tag ("latest") instead of a
commit hash. Otherwise we have a chicken-and-egg problem: the approved list of
actions would need to know the has for the commit that saves the update to the
action.

## Full example

This example shows how to use the action to get a json file with all the used
actions in an organization. The json file is uploaded as an artefact in the
third step.

``` yaml
jobs:
  load-all-used-actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2

      - uses: ./action-allowedlist
        name: Scan used actions
        id: scan-action

      - name: Upload result file as artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@6f51ac03b9356f520e9adb1b1b7802705f340c2b # v4.5.0
        with:
          name: actions
          path: ./actions.json
```

## Outputs

actions: a json string with all the unapproved actions used in the workflows in
the repo. The json is in the format:

``` json
[
  {
    "actionLink": "actions/checkout",
    "actionVersion": "v2"
  }
]
```

Properties:

| Name          | Description                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| actionLink    | The link to the action used in the workflow    |
| actionVersion | The version of the action used in the workflow |
