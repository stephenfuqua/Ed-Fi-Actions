Include into your workflow file:

``` yaml
    name: Linter
    uses: Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-Actions/.github/workflows/powershell-analyzer.yml@latest
```

This will automatically analyze all the PowerShell scripts and modules in the
repo, and will generate a SARIF report that will be included into
`https://github.com/{ORGANIZATION}/{REPOSITORY}/security/code-scanning`
